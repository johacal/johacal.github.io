		<h1>Women in the Gaming Community</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>As of 2020, women make up half of the gaming community and world population (Isaaman, 2023).<br>
			The hotspot for gaming, Asia, accounting for 48% of total gaming revenue, has grown its female gaming demographic to 40-45% (Google and Niko Partners in Yokoi, 2021).<br>

			<h2>Why do women game?</h2>
			In France, women are motivated by challenging themselves; whereas men cope with stress and seek achieviements success in competing.<br>
			Taiwanese females gamers also play for achievements and social status and men play out of boredom.<br>
			In the US, women play for the same reasons as in Taiwan and in adition, they develop socially whilst maintaining relationships (Yokoi, 202i).<br>
			<br>
			This shows how complex the gaming population has become. Whilst there are similarities in why women game across the globe, in different cultures, we see similarities in men and women.<br>
