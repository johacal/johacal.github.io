			<p>Lab 2<br>
				The Pudding: The Birthday Paradox<br>
				The audience<br>
					Children<br>
					It is an interactive and captivating way of learning simple probability.<br>
				Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers<br>
					The purpose is to explain how simple probability can be if you understand the grounds it works on.<br>
					Easy to navigate, minimal buttons/choices<br>
					The navigation is fairly simple with a back button.<br>
					The illustrations and animations are what make it more appealing to children.<br>
				Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity<br>
					The background enables multiple elements to be presented at once without the user getting lost. Simple graphics make it not too overwhelming for children to remember.<br>
					It is well centred in the middle of the screen.<br>
					Consistent with introducing new ideas and keeping the same style and tone.<br>
				Content Design<br>
					It identified something that children can struggle with, a particular problem in education. They combined various media elements for the children to visualise and hopefully remember with visual cues.<br>
					Certain problems in education arise due to overcomplicated explanations in books and by teachers. Simplifying everything and make it it fun to look at transforms the way children look at education.<br>
					<br>
					The Pudding: The Sounds of Mexico City<br>
				The audience<br>
					Anyone<br>
				Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers<br>
					Visual pleasing and artistically innovative<br>
					Various audiences would appreciate such a brilliant use of multimedia in an engaging and informative way.<br>
				Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity<br>
					The animation give it a certain tone and atmosphere.<br>
					Adding real life sounds contextualises the issue.<br>
					Consistency in presentation leaves the reader more drawn to read the text.<br>
				Content Design<br>
					It is informative and light-hearted but serious at the same time.<br>
					It found a social problem, specific to a location, that might not widely discussed.<br>
					Due to certain communities being more outcast with the digital age, by bringing light onto social issues that might be happening around you without you knowing, this design succeeded in increasing awareness to problems in urban planning.<br>
				Task 2: Consider your audience<br>
				<br>
				Using a simplistic design and introducing a few elements at a time might make it more memorable, captivating and not too overwhelming. Stick to a few colours and styles as not to confuse or take their attention from the text/purpose.<br>
				<br>
