		<h1>Week 3</h1>
		<p>IL Activity 3<br>
Task 1:<br>
Thematic navigational/conceptual structure will logically connect the three sections. The issue will be explained by introducing the wider context and environment and delving deeper into the industry.
They will have to be above 18, employed in or part of the gaming community, and ideally educated in the gaming industry as well.
The use of multimedia, such as images, will serve me as evidence to prove the severity of the issue. This will help me contextualise the problem and inform the audience with credibility. <br>
<br>
Task 3:<br>
Reflective Statement: The website will aim to contextualise the issue of how women are currently situated in the gaming world. This should be done through an informative and educational tone, instead of attempting to persuade and take a robust stance that might seem confrontational and hostile. 
It needs to come from a neutral place, addressing both men and women in the gaming industry. By informing these individuals, they might be able to address the issue if they have any power over the matter. This is why this will be targeted at professionals established in the sector of game development who are able to make a change by actions or just reflection over the current situation. Internal dialogue and contemplation may lead to increased awareness.
The design should be interactive and engaging to not only sustain their attention span but also uphold to their standards and the content they consume.
