		<h1>Week 1: IL Activity 1</h1>
		<p>1.	Information literacy: importance of it, the impact it has had in campaigns<br>
			2.	Patriarchal propaganda: link between historical sources and contemporary marketing techniques on the internet<br>
			3.	Women in games and the gaming industry: objectification, female workers, sexual assualt<br>	
			4.	Digitisation of official documents: issues and advantages of digitised documents (official/legal)<br>
			5.	Indigenous culture preservation: lack of awareness, indigenous languages and their digitisation, preservation of sources<br>
			6.	Feminism in media: portrayal in media catered to various audiences<br>
			7.	Gender based marketing: use of personal data, efficacy<br>
			<br>
			Task 2<br>
			1.	With the diversity of the gaming community growing, has there been a shift in the potrayal of women (previously scrutonised for objectification and over-sexualisation)? Are women treated differently in the community and industry, and has it changed in the past few years? Is there a pay gap?<br>
			<br>
			Key words: gender, game industry, identity, online discourse, diversity, gamer culture, online harassment, organizational response, rumination, sexism, sexual harassment, video games, women in gaming<br>
			<br>
			Log of search words: women, games, female characters, games development, video games, sexism, gaming<br>
			<br>
			3) Google Scholar proved very useful.<br>
			There seems to be a lot of literature and even literature reviews on women in games and the industry. A lot of these sources dive deep into specific repercussions, such as rape justification, online harassment, and sexism. Whilst Google Scholar may be very helpful in finding reputable sources that attempt to remain as impartial as possible, bias will be the biggest limitation in this research. Most of these authors seem to be women and to get a balanced perspective, I will have to find sources from various sides of the debate.<br>
