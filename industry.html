		<p>
			
23% of those who work in the game development industry are women, and all women working in tech and IT are far less likely to a career in coding and developing video games. They are also in far less senior positions. As of now, there are only a handful of studios owned and run by women.

With challenges, such as a toxic environment both women in the industry and female players. Cyber bullying and sexual harassment at events and online, discrimination are a few examples of what women in the community have to deal with.

Reported 72% of female players experience some degree of toxicity that can develop to violent verbal abuse and threats of rape.

All his may affect their mental health and discourage them from their dream career. It is time for change(Isaaman, 2023).<br>
